## Description
Personalizing our data has become an essential feature of almost any web application. Ready to Read allows the user to search for books (using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) to fetch book data), and save searched books so they can build a reading list or just for future reference.  This is a full stack MERN application that utilizes a query based server, [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).
